package org.omnetpp.inet.Applications.TCPApp;

//
// Accepts any number of incoming TCP connections, and sends back the
// messages that arrive on them, The lengths of the messages are
// multiplied by echoFactor before sending them back (echoFactor=1 will
// result in sending back the same message unmodified.) The reply can also be
// delayed by a constant time (echoDelay parameter).
//
// When TCPEchoApp receives data packets from TCP (and such, when they can be
// echoed) depends on the sendQueue/receiveQueue setting of TCP.
// With TCPVirtualBytesSendQueue/RcvQueue, TCP passes up data to us
// as soon as a segment arrives, so it can be echoed immediately.
// With TCPMsgBasedSendQueue/RcvQueue, our local TCP reproduces the same
// messages that the sender app passed down to its TCP -- so if the sender
// app sent a single 100 MB message, it will be echoed only when all
// 100 megabytes have arrived.
//
// Compatible with both IPv4 and IPv6.
