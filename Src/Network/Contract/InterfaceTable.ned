// Keeps the table of network interfaces.
//
// Interfaces are dynamically registered by the corresponding L2 modules, e.g.
// PPPInterface. In addition to registered interfaces, a loopback interface
// will also be created. This table only contains protocol-independent
// properties of interfaces -- IP or IPv6 specific per-interface data
// (addresses etc) are kept in RoutingTable and RoutingTable6.
//
// This module has no gates; all functionality can be accessed via member
// functions of the C++ module class. For detailed info, please see the C++
// documentation of the class (Doxygen).
