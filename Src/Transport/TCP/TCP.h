/**
 * Implements the TCP protocol. This section describes the internal
 * architecture of the TCP model.
 *
 * Usage and compliance with various RFCs are discussed in the corresponding
 * NED documentation for TCP. Also, you may want to check the TCPSocket
 * class which makes it easier to use TCP from applications.
 *
 * The TCP protocol implementation is composed of several classes (discussion
 * follows below):
 *  - TCP: the module class
 *  - TCPConnection: manages a connection
 *  - TCPSendQueue, TCPReceiveQueue: abstract base classes for various types
 *    of send and receive queues
 *  - TCPVirtualDataSendQueue and TCPVirtualDataRcvQueue which implement
 *    queues with "virtual" bytes (byte counts only)
 *  - TCPAlgorithm: abstract base class for TCP algorithms, and subclasses:
 *    DumbTCP, TCPBaseAlg, TCPTahoeRenoFamily, TCPTahoe, TCPReno.
 *
 * TCP subclassed from cSimpleModule. It manages socketpair-to-connection
 * mapping, and dispatches segments and user commands to the appropriate
 * TCPConnection object.
 *
 * TCPConnection manages the connection, with the help of other objects.
 * TCPConnection itself implements the basic TCP "machinery": takes care
 * of the state machine, stores the state variables (TCB), sends/receives
 * SYN, FIN, RST, ACKs, etc.
 *
 * TCPConnection internally relies on 3 objects. The first two are subclassed
 * from TCPSendQueue and TCPReceiveQueue. They manage the actual data stream,
 * so TCPConnection itself only works with sequence number variables.
 * This makes it possible to easily accomodate need for various types of
 * simulated data transfer: real byte stream, "virtual" bytes (byte counts
 * only), and sequence of cMessage objects (where every message object is
 * mapped to a TCP sequence number range).
 *
 * Currently implemented send queue and receive queue classes are
 * TCPVirtualDataSendQueue and TCPVirtualDataRcvQueue which implement
 * queues with "virtual" bytes (byte counts only).
 *
 * The third object is subclassed from TCPAlgorithm. Control over
 * retransmissions, congestion control and ACK sending are "outsourced"
 * from TCPConnection into TCPAlgorithm: delayed acks, slow start, fast rexmit,
 * etc. are all implemented in TCPAlgorithm subclasses. This simplifies the
 * design of TCPConnection and makes it a lot easier to implement new TCP
 * variations such as NewReno, Vegas or LinuxTCP as TCPAlgorithm subclasses.
 *
 * Currently implemented TCPAlgorithm classes are DumbTCP, TCPTahoe, TCPReno, etc.
 *
 * The concrete TCPAlgorithm class to use can be chosen per connection (in OPEN)
 * or in a module parameter.
