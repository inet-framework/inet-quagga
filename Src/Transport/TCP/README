TCP
===

This folder contains the "base part" of TCP, basically the operation
described in RFC793. This base algorithm can be extended and customized via
"flavour" and "queue" classes that implement the TCPAlgorith, TCPSendQueue
and TCPReceiveQueue classes, and are selected via TCP's NED parameters.

The main class is TCP, which manages a set of TCPConnections. A TCP segment
is instance of the TCPSegment class.
