	* TCPConnectionEventProc.cc, TCPConnectionRcvSegment.cc: when the user
	issues CLOSE, defer transition to FIN_WAIT_1 until all data are sent.
	(Before this fix the transiton was made immediately, but that was 
	harmless, i.e. it didn't affect TCP's external behaviour.)

	* TCPConnectionRcvSegment.cc: fixed incorrect behaviour when ACK of SYN
	carries data [reported by Joachim Meichle]

	* some sources moved into subdirs queues/ and flavours/

	* TCPMain renamed to TCP

	* TCPMain.cc, TCPConnectionBase.cc: TCP got confused when it received 
	several active/passive opens with same local port number. Now it raises
	an error (this is like EADDRINUSE on *nix)

	* TCPConnectionRcvSegment.cc: fixed bug which caused closing of a
	connection to be reported 2MSL (240s) later to the user. Basically,
	the user has to be notified already when the connection enters the
	TIME_WAIT state. (TCP stays in TIME_WAIT for 240s or longer, and 
	nothing can happen during that time that's of interest to the user.)
