// Using NotificationBoard, modules can now notify each other about
// "events" such as routing table changes, interface status changes (up/down),
// interface configuration changes, wireless handovers, changes in the state
// of the wireless channel, mobile node position changes, etc.
//
// The NotificationBoard has exactly one instance within a host or router
// model, and acts as a intermediary between module where state changes
// can occur and modules which are interested in learning about those
// changes.
//
// NotificationBoard is accessed via direct C++ method calls (not
// message exchange). Modules can "subscribe" to categories of changes
// (e.g. "routing table changed" or "radio channel became empty").
// When such a change occurs, the corresponding module (e.g. the RoutingTable
// or the physical layer module) will let NotificationBoard know, and
// it will disseminate this information to all interested modules.
