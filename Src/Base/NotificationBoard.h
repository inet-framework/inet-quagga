/**
 * Acts as a intermediary between module where state changes can occur and
 * modules which are interested in learning about those changes;
 * "Notification Broker".
 *
 * Notification events are grouped into "categories." Examples of categories
 * are: NF_HOSTPOSITION_UPDATED, NF_RADIOSTATE_CHANGED, NF_PP_TX_BEGIN,
 * NF_PP_TX_END, NF_IPv4_ROUTINGTABLE_CHANGED, NF_BEACON_LOST
 * NF_NODE_FAILURE, NF_NODE_RECOVERY, etc. Each category is identified by
 * an integer (right now it's assigned in the source code via an enum,
 * in the future we'll convert to dynamic category registration).
 *
 * To trigger a notification, the client must obtain a pointer to the
 * NotificationBoard of the given host or router (explained later), and
 * call its fireChangeNotification() method. The notification will be
 * delivered to all subscribed clients immediately, inside the
 * fireChangeNotification() call.
 *
 * Clients that wish to receive notifications should implement (subclass from)
 * the INotifiable interface, obtain a pointer to the NotificationBoard,
 * and subscribe to the categories they are interested in by calling the
 * subscribe() method of the NotificationBoard. Notifications will be
 * delivered to the receiveChangeNotification() method of the client
 * (redefined from INotifiable).
 *
 * In cases when the category itself (an int) does not carry enough information
 * about the notification event, one can pass additional information
 * in a data class. There is no restriction on what the data class may contain,
 * except that it has to be subclassed from cPolymorphic, and of course
 * producers and consumers of notifications should agree on its contents.
 * If no extra info is needed, one can pass a NULL pointer in the
 * fireChangeNotification() method.
 *
 * A module which implements INotifiable looks like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * class Foo : public cSimpleModule, public INotifiable {
 *     ...
 *     virtual void receiveChangeNotification(int category, cPolymorphic *details) {..}
 *     ...
 * };
 * </pre>
 *
 * Obtaining a pointer to the NotificationBoard module of that host/router:
 *
 * <pre>
 * NotificationBoard *nb; // this is best made a module class member
 * nb = NotificationBoardAccess().get();  // best done in initialize()
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * See NED file for additional info.
 *
 * @see INotifiable
