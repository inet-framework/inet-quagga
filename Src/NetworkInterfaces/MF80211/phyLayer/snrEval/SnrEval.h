/**
 * @brief Keeps track of the different snir levels when receiving a
 * packet
 *
 * This module keeps track of the noise level of the channel.
 *
 * When receiving a packet this module updates the noise level of the
 * channel. Based on the receive power of the packet it is processed
 * and handed to upper layers or just treated as noise.
 *
 * After the packet is completely received the snir information is
 * attached and it is handed to the decider module.
 *
 * The snir information is a SnrList that lists all different snr
 * levels together with the point of time (simTime()) when they
 * started.
 *
 * On top of that this module manages the RadioState, and posts notifications
 * on NotificationBoard whenever it changes. The radio state gives information
 * about whether this module is sending a packet, receiving a packet or idle.
 * This information can be accessed via the NotificationBoard by other modules,
 * e.g. a CSMAMacLayer.
