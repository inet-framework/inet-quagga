 * conditions apply:
 *
 * -# the power of the received signal is higher than the
 * sensitivity.
 * -# the host is currently not sending a message
 * -# no other packet is already being received
 *
 * If all conditions apply a new SnrList is created and the RadioState
 * is changed to RECV. If the Gilbert Elliot model is in state BAD,
 * the frame is marked as corrupted. The cMessage's bitError flag is used
 * for it.
 * If the packet is just noise the receive power is added to the noise
 * Level of the channel. Additionally the snr information of the
