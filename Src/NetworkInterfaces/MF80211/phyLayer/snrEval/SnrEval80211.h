/**
 * @brief A SnrEval for the 802.11b protocol
 *
 * Subclass of SnrEval. Basically the same except for some extra
 * parameters of 802.11 and the duration of the packet that has to be
 * computed differently as the modulation of header and data part of the
 * packet are different. This module forms a physical layer together with
 * the Decider80211 module. The resulting physical layer is intended to
 * be used together with the Mac80211 module.
