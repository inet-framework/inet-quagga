/**
 * @brief Decider for the 802.11 modules
 *
 * Depending on the minimum of the snr included in the PhySDU this
 * module computes a bit error probability. The header (1 Mbit/s) is
 * always modulated with DBQPSK. The PDU is normally modulated either
 * with DBPSK (1 and 2 Mbit/s) or CCK (5.5 and 11 Mbit/s). CCK is not
 * easy to model, therefore it is modeled as DQPSK with a 16-QAM for
 * 5.5 Mbit/s and a 256-QAM for 11 Mbit/s.
