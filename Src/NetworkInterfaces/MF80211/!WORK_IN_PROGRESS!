This implementation (based on the Mobility Framework) currently only supports
802.11b ad-hoc mode. Adding functionality to support infrastructure mode 
(access points, handling management frames, etc) is in progress.

We're seeking contributors to integrate IPv6Suite's 802.11 model ("Wireless")
as well.
