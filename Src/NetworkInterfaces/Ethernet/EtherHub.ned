// A generic wiring hub model.
//
// ethg[i] gates represent ports. Messages arriving on a port are broadcast 
// to every other port.
//
// The connections should have data rate set to zero. Cable lengths
// should be reflected in the delays of the connections.
//
// Messages are not interpreted by the hub model in any way, thus the hub
// model is not specific to Ethernet in any way. Messages may
// represent anything, from the beginning of a frame transmission to
// end (or abortion) of transmission.
