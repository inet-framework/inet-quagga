/**
 * Abstract base class for radio modules. Radio modules deal with the 
 * transmission of frames over a wireless medium (the radio channel).
 * See the Radio module's NED documentation for an overview of radio modules.
 *
 * This class implements common functionality of the radio, and abstracts
 * out specific parts into two interfaces, IReceptionModel and IRadioModel.
 * The reception model is responsible for modelling path loss, interference
 * and antenna gain. The radio model is responsible for calculating frame
 * duration, and modelling modulation scheme and possible forward error
 * correction. Subclasses have to redefine the <tt>createReceptionModel()</tt>
 * and <tt>createRadioModel()</tt> methods to create and return appropriate
 * reception model and radio model objects.
 *
 * <b>History</b>
 *
 * The implementation is largely based on the Mobility Framework's
 * SnrEval and Decider modules. They have been merged into a single
 * module, multi-channel support, runtime channel and bitrate switching
 * capability added, and all code specific to the physical channel
 * and radio characteristics have been factored out into the IReceptionModel
 * and IRadioModel classes.
