	* added support for quagga-0.99.12. (Both quagga-0.98.5 and quagga-0.99.12
	are provided; the user can switch between them by adjusting the quagga
	symlink in the src/quaggasrc directory).

	* several bugfixes, some of them related to 64-bit support

	* no longer compiles with Visual C++. (The quagga code is full of uses
	of GCC extensions like initializing structs with field names, and it 
	would require significant refactoring to transform such constructs to 
	something VC++ (or any non-GNU compiler) understands).

	* ported to OMNeT++ 4.0 and matching INET Framework

	* split from the INET Framework and turned into a separate project,
	because this codebase is a lot more sensitive to platform than the
	base INET.

	* added #undef si_pid, si_uid, si_status, si_value, si_band, and 
	si_addr into generic_env.h, for Solaris x86 compatibility (these
	struct siginfo field names are macros there that to refer to other 
	struct fields) [patch from Devendra Jaisinghani]
