//
// \TCP protocol implementation. Supports RFC 793, RFC 1122, RFC 2001.
// Compatible with both IPv4 and IPv6.
//
// A \TCP segment is represented by the class TCPSegment.
//
// <b>Communication with clients</b>
//
// For communication between client applications and TCP, the TcpCommandCode
// and TcpStatusInd enums are used as message kinds, and TCPCommand
// and its subclasses are used as control info.
//
// To open a connection from a client app, send a cMessage to TCP with
// TCP_C_OPEN_ACTIVE as message kind and a TCPOpenCommand object filled in
// and attached to it as control info. (The peer TCP will have to be LISTENing;
// the server app can achieve this with a similar cMessage but TCP_C_OPEN_PASSIVE
// message kind.) With passive open, there's a possibility to cause the connection
// "fork" on an incoming connection, leaving the original connection LISTENing
// on the port (see the fork field in TCPOpenCommand).
//
// The client app can send data by assigning the TCP_C_SEND message kind
// and attaching a TCPSendCommand control info object to the data packet,
// and sending it to TCP. The server app will receive data as messages
// with the TCP_I_DATA message kind and TCPSendCommand control info.
// (Whether you'll receive the same or identical messages, or even whether
// you'll receive data in the same sized chunks as sent depends on the
// sendQueueClass and receiveQueueClass used, see below. With
// TCPVirtualDataSendQueue and TCPVirtualDataRcvQueue set, message objects
// and even message boundaries are not preserved.)
//
// To close, the client sends a cMessage to TCP with the TCP_C_CLOSE message kind
// and TCPCommand control info.
//
// TCP sends notifications to the application whenever there's a significant
// change in the state of the connection: established, remote TCP closed,
// closed, timed out, connection refused, connection reset, etc. These
// notifications are also cMessages with message kind TCP_I_xxx
// (TCP_I_ESTABLISHED, etc.) and TCPCommand as control info.
//
// One TCP module can serve several application modules, and several
// connections per application. The <i>k</i>th application connects to TCP's
// from_appl[k] and to_appl[k] ports. When talking to applications, a
// connection is identified by the (application port index, connId) pair,
// where connId is assigned by the application in the OPEN call.
//
// <b>Sockets</b>
//
// The TCPSocket C++ class is provided to simplify managing \TCP connections
// from applications. TCPSocket handles the job of assembling and sending
// command messages (OPEN, CLOSE, etc) to TCP, and it also simplifies
// the task of dealing with packets and notification messages coming from TCP.
//
// <b>Communication with the \IP layer</b>
//
// The TCP model relies on sending and receiving IPControlInfo objects
// attached to \TCP segment objects as control info
// (see cMessage::setControlInfo()).
//
// <b>Configuring TCP</b>
//
// The module parameters sendQueueClass and receiveQueueClass should be
// set the names of classes that manage the actual send and receive queues.
// Currently you have two choices:
//
//   -# set them to "TCPVirtualDataSendQueue" and "TCPVirtualDataRcvQueue".
//      These classes manage "virtual bytes", that is, only byte counts are
//      transmitted over the \TCP connection and no actual data. cMessage
//      contents, and even message boundaries are not preserved with these
//      classes: for example, if the client sends a single cMessage with
//      length = 1 megabyte over TCP, the receiver-side client will see a
//      sequence of MSS-sized messages.
//
//   -# use "TCPMsgBasedSendQueue" and "TCPMsgBasedRcvQueue", which transmit
//      cMessage objects (and subclasses) over a \TCP connection. The same
//      message object sequence that was sent by the client to the
//      sender-side TCP entity will be reproduced on the receiver side.
//      If a client sends a cMessage with length = 1 megabyte, the
//      receiver-side client will receive the same message object (or a clone)
//      after the TCP entities have completed simulating the transmission
//      of 1 megabyte over the connection. This is a different behaviour
//      from TCPVirtualDataSendQueue/RcvQueue.
//
// It depends on the client (app) modules which sendQueue/rcvQueue they require.
// For example, TCPGenericSrvApp needs message-based sendQueue/rcvQueue,
// while TCPEchoApp or TCPSinkApp can work with any (but TCPEchoApp will
// display different behaviour with both!)
//
// In the future, other send queue and receive queue classes may be
// implemented, e.g. to allow transmission of "raw bytes" (actual byte arrays).
//
// The \TCP flavour supported depends on the value of the tcpAlgorithmClass
// module parameters, e.g. "TCPTahoe" or "TCPReno". In the future, other
// classes can be written which implement New Reno, Vegas, LinuxTCP (which
// differs from others) or other variants.
//
// Note that TCPOpenCommand allows sendQueueClass, receiveQueueClass and
// tcpAlgorithmClass to be chosen per-connection.
//
// Notes:
//  - if you do active OPEN, then send data and close before the connection
//    has reached ESTABLISHED, the connection will go from SYN_SENT to CLOSED
//    without actually sending the buffered data. This is consistent with 
//    rfc 763 but may not be what you'd expect.
//  - handling segments with SYN+FIN bits set (esp. with data too) is
//    inconsistent across TCPs, so check this one if it's of importance
//
// <b>Standards</b>
//
// The TCP module itself implements the following:
//  - all RFC793 \TCP states and state transitions
//  - connection setup and teardown as in RFC793
//  - generally, RFC793 compliant segment processing
//  - all socked commands (except RECEIVE) and indications
//  - receive buffer to cache above-sequence data and data not yet forwarded
//    to the user
//  - CONN-ESTAB timer, SYN-REXMIT timer, 2MSL timer, FIN-WAIT-2 timer
//
// The TCPTahoe and TCPReno algorithms implement:
//  - delayed acks, with 200ms timeout (optional)
//  - Nagle's algorithm (optional)
//  - Jacobson's and Karn's algorithms for round-trip time measurement and
//    adaptive retransmission
//  - \TCP Tahoe (Fast Retransmit), \TCP Reno (Fast Retransmit and Fast Recovery)
//
// Missing bits:
//  - URG and PSH bits not handled. Receiver always acts as if PSH was set
//    on all segments: always forwards data to the app as soon as possible.
//  - finite receive buffer size is not modelled (always the maximum
//    window size, currently 16K is advertised)
//  - no RECEIVE command. Received data are always forwarded to the app as
//    soon as possible, as if the app issued a very large RECEIVE request
//    at the beginning. This means there's currently no flow control
//    between TCP and the app.
//  - no \TCP header options (e.g. MSS is currently module parameter; no SACK;
//    no timestamp option for more frequent round-trip time measurement per 
//    rfc 2988 section 3
//  - all timeouts are precisely calculated: timer granularity (which is caused 
//    by "slow" and "fast" i.e. 500ms and 200ms timers found in many *nix \TCP
//    implementations) is not simulated
//
// TCPTahoe/TCPReno issues and missing features:
//  - PERSIST timer not implemented (currently no problem, because receiver
//    never advertises 0 window size)
//  - KEEPALIVE not implemented (idle connections never time out)
//  - Nagle's algorithm possibly not precisely implemented
//
// The above problems are relatively easy to fix, and will be resolved in the
// next iteration. Also, other TCPAlgorithms will be added.
//
// <b>Tests</b>
//
// There are automated test cases (*.test files) for TCP -- see the Test
// directory in the source distribution.
