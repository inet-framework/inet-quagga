Quagga for OMNeT++
==================

Quagga (www.quagga.net; formerly called Zebra) is an open-source routing
package for Linux and other *nix systems. Quagga supports RIP, OSPF, ISIS,
BGP4 and OSPFv6.

INET-Quagga is an effort to bring dynamic routing facility into INET
simulations by using modified version of Quagga. It is done by placing
a syscall emulation layer between Quagga and INET Framework components.
Further changes

Initial implementation was done by Vojta Janota. Currently the project
is maintained by OMNeT++ developers (Tamas Borbely, Andras Varga et al.)

Usage
-----
Please have a look at the example simulations and the QuaggaRouter compound
module!

A normal Quagga router can be configured with files in the etc/quagga/.
A simulated Quagga router can be configured with the same files, but the
file system root can be specified for each router in the "fsroot" module
parameter. A router with fsroot = "r1" will read the following files:

    r1/_etc_quagga_bgpd.conf
    r1/_etc_quagga_ospfd.conf
    r1/_etc_quagga_ripd.conf
    r1/_etc_quagga_zebra.conf

Where r1 is a subdir of the working directory. Slash has been replaced with
underscore in the file paths to avoid deep directory trees.
